"@reown/walletkit": patch
---

Update `@walletconnect/core`, `sign-client`, `types`, `utils` from 2.23.4 to 2.23.5 and `@walletconnect/pay` from 1.0.2 to 1.0.3. Pay SDK now includes WASM provider support, enabling pay functionality in browser/Node.js environments without requiring a React Native native module.
